# TODO

- check for the faster Porteus repository only when downloading the ISO.
- test to deal with EXT4 and sync/umount in background while writing VFAT.
- test a different order of umount compared with the current (v0.3.1).
- write the VFAT in a tmpfs loop and dd in its partition as speed test.
- check about swapability and add "noswap", which is a performance killer.
- evaluate to add zram swap for those case can make a difference.
- ask for selecting the best mirror ONLY when downloading ISO.
- download ALL the SHA256 checksum files and check for coherence among them.
- include the cvt + xrandr tweak for DVI to VGA adapters at 1280x1024.
- if many ISO files have been found, let the user choose among them.
