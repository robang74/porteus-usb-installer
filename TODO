# TODO

- check for the faster Porteus repository only when downloading the ISO.
- ask for selecting the best mirror ONLY when downloading ISO.
- check for coherence among ALL the SHA256 checksum files.
- if many ISO files have been found, let the user choose among them.
- evaluate to add zram swap for those case can make a difference.
    - rc.local additions about swapability (60) and set it to five.
- start using porteus-v5.0-x86_64.cfg because /boot /EFI updates.
- move all git contribs into a tree for porteus/rootcopy/ dir.

# DONE

v test to deal with EXT4 and sync/umount in background while writing VFAT.
v test a different order of umount compared with the current (v0.3.1).
v write the VFAT in a tmpfs loop and dd in its partition as speed test.
v add "noswap", because swap is a performance killer.
v download ALL the SHA256 checksum files
v include the cvt + xrandr tweak for DVI to VGA adapters at 1280x1024.
    v .xprofile/session should deal with the DVI-VGA adapters
